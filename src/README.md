# Echo Bot template
This template demonstrates a simple echo bot with state with ASP.Net Core 2. The bot maintains a simple counter that increases with each message from the user.

# Prerequisite to run this bot locally
- Download the bot code from the Build blade in the Azure Portal
- Update the `appsettings.json` file in the root of the bot project with the botFilePath and botFileSecret 
- You can find the botFilePath and botFileSecret in the Azure App Service application settings.

Your appsettings.json file should look like this
```bash
{
    "botFilePath": "<copy value from App settings>",
    "botFileSecret": "<copy value from App settings>"
}
```


## Run in Visual Studio
- Open the .sln file with Visual Studio.
- Press F5.
## Run in Visual Studio Code
- Open the bot project folder with Visual Studio Code.
- Bring up a terminal.
- Type 'dotnet run'.
## Testing the bot using Bot Framework Emulator
[Microsoft Bot Framework Emulator](https://aka.ms/botframework-emulator) is a desktop application that allows bot developers to test and debug
their bots on localhost or running remotely through a tunnel.
- Install the Bot Framework Emulator from [here](https://aka.ms/botframework-emulator).
### Connect to bot using Bot Framework Emulator
- Launch the Bot Framework Emulator
- File -> Open bot and navigate to the bot project folder
- Select `<your-bot-name>.bot` file

# Bot state
A key to good bot design is to track the context of a conversation, so that your bot remembers things like the answers to previous questions. Depending on what your bot is used for, you may even need to keep track of conversation state or store user related information for longer than the lifetime of one given conversation.

In this example, the bot's state is used to track number of messages.

 A bot's state is information it remembers in order to respond appropriately to incoming messages. The Bot Builder SDK provides classes for [storing and retrieving state data](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-howto-v4-state?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=js) as an object associated with a user or a conversation.

    - Conversation properties help your bot keep track of the current conversation the bot is having with the user. If your bot needs to complete a sequence of steps or switch between conversation topics, you can use conversation properties to manage steps in a sequence or track the current topic. Since conversation properties reflect the state of the current conversation, you typically clear them at the end of a session, when the bot receives an end of conversation activity.
    
    - User properties can be used for many purposes, such as determining where the user's prior conversation left off or simply greeting a returning user by name. If you store a user's preferences, you can use that information to customize the conversation the next time you chat. For example, you might alert the user to a news article about a topic that interests her, or alert a user when an appointment becomes available. You should clear them if the bot receives a delete user data activity.


# Deploy this bot to Azure
## Publish from Visual Studio
- Open the .PublishSettings file you find in the PostDeployScripts folder
- Copy the userPWD value
- Right click on the Project and click on "Publish..."
- Paste the password you just copied and publish

## Publish using the CLI tools
You can use the [MSBot](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-tools) Bot Builder CLI tool to clone and configure any services this sample depends on. 
To install all Bot Builder tools - 
```bash
npm i -g msbot chatdown ludown qnamaker luis-apis botdispatch luisgen
```
To clone this bot, run
```
msbot clone services -f deploymentScripts/msbotClone -n <BOT-NAME> -l <Azure-location> --subscriptionId <Azure-subscription-id>
```
